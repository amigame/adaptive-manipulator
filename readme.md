I THINK, THEREFORE I AM

A riddle-survival game inspired by Harlan Ellison's short story named "[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream)".

This game has no relation with the [homonymous title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream_(video_game)) developed by The Dreamers Guild, co-designed by Ellison and published by Cyberdreams in 1995 - although we do love it dearly.

Contained here is the full source code, released as open source. This is a community project and your active participation in improving the game is welcomed. 


## Story

It's 109 years after the complete destruction of human civilization. The last world war, fought mainly between China, Russia, and the United States, escalated to a global warfare that lasted years. As the war progressed, the three warring nations each created a super-computer capable of running the war more efficiently than humans. The machines are each referred to as "AM," which originally stood for "Allied Mastercomputer," and then was later called "Adaptive Manipulator." Finally, "AM" was given the nickname "Aggressive Menace". One day, one of the three computers become self aware, and promptly absorbed the other two, thus taking control of the entire war. What followed after that can only be characterized as mass genocide...

Now with most of the human race gone AM salvages the last surviving people in elaborate prisons, tormenting them with almost impossible riddles and morality challenges. 

You are AM.
